The seperateScript is finnished now we need to make sure what happens when we use the playerIndex
- switch scene //DONE
After that is done we need to add:
- calculation for deaths
- calculation for kills
After we have added a function that adds the kills and deaths we need to summarize the total of both
kills and deaths:
- Summarize
- KDR = K/D || Let me specify this. This is how you calculate the average kdr(kill death ratio).
